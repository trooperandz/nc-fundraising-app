// David's app
  // build the app 
    npx remix vite:build
  // serve the app
    npx remix-serve build/server/index.js

  // OR if you want to run with your own express server 
  node server.js

  // Now that you own your server, you can debug your app with whatever tooling your server has. For example, you can inspect your app with chrome devtools with the Node.js inspect flag:
    node --inspect server.js

  // Vite middleware is not applied if process.env.NODE_ENV is set to "production", in which case you'll still be running the regular build output as you did earlier.

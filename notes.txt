// David's app
  // build the app 
    npx remix vite:build
  // serve the app
    npx remix-serve build/server/index.js

  // OR if you want to run with your own express server 
  node server.js

  // Now that you own your server, you can debug your app with whatever tooling your server has. For example, you can inspect your app with chrome devtools with the Node.js inspect flag:
    node --inspect server.js

  // Vite middleware is not applied if process.env.NODE_ENV is set to "production", in which case you'll still be running the regular build output as you did earlier.

Questions for David 
  Default check "financial" delivery type when add a quantity to a delivery item?
  Want to show entire description? (kind of long)
  Do you want to allow both a financial AND a materials donation (i.e. both routes possible)?
  Do you want to hide materials that have quantity remaining of zero?
  What about login etc?  Want the user to be able to make an account before going through the donation flow?
    And if already have an account, the contact step/page is skipped?

TODOs
  Add table footer with totals for materials table?
  ONly show a proceed button on materials page after a selection has been made?
  Need any error handling for the selections at all?

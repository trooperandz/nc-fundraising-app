// David's app
  // build the app 
    npx remix vite:build
  // serve the app
    npx remix-serve build/server/index.js

  // OR if you want to run with your own express server 
  node server.js

  // Now that you own your server, you can debug your app with whatever tooling your server has. For example, you can inspect your app with chrome devtools with the Node.js inspect flag:
    node --inspect server.js

  // Vite middleware is not applied if process.env.NODE_ENV is set to "production", in which case you'll still be running the regular build output as you did earlier.

Code notes

    How to track state?

          qantity: number;
          price: number;
        }

Questions for David 
  Default check "financial" delivery type when add a quantity to a delivery item?
  Want to show entire description? (kind of long)
  Do you want to allow both a financial AND a materials donation (i.e. both routes possible)?
  Do you want to hide materials that have quantity remaining of zero?
  What about login etc?  Want the user to be able to make an account before going through the donation flow?
    And if already have an account, the contact step/page is skipped?

TODOs
  Add table footer with totals for materials table?
  ONly show a proceed button on materials page after a selection has been made?
  Need any error handling for the selections at all?
    
Do you need the button at the end to whipe out donation style?

TODOs 
  loading/error states on pages 
  user login / account stuff
    haven't done any actual user auth stuff yet
    David said no users will be logging in; so you can just rely on the contact information flow as-is, and also can probably remove the profile icon from menu
  no "error" handling on the financial donation page or materials donation pages yet (can press the button with no errors)
  materials delivery type stuff at checkout
  conditional profile menu dropdown items (i.e. if not logged in, don't show "My Account", show "Log In", for instance)
  overall styling (very basic now, no fancy or professional stuff really)
  Do you need an admin page for you for donations summary etc?
  Stripe payment processing integration
  social sharing completion
  mobile-responsiveness review; esp the materials table etc
  materials table -> what about items that say remaining 0; hide those?
    also need to finish the table input; you can type in it and we don't want that; also the input styling is stock browser
  do you want the preset donation button amounts to come from an api?
  general state management (i.e. only submit "cart" state at some point; the info is global now so will be in the cart once they enter amounts)
  phone number input formatting (as you type); right now the validation is 10 digits (no other chars)
  determine when to clear out cart state when payment setup is actually completed (now clearing the state on "Submit Payment")
  want the About page?
  want the Projects page?
  sign out menu item is static; not rigged up
  nothing done yet with any /sessions stuff 
  what is the /requesters endpoint for?
  need a favicon icon
  need to add some navigation links/breadcrumbs to the views for better navigation
  need to put it on a server with node so it can build

Stripe 
  #=>m9wLA':iFtHk

Stripe link page from David:
  https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_test_a1cqoFrjUsWlx1XiTQVWSAuBBrgliDnksYydrpN3krzDfdhrIqCRo4zc5r#fidkdWxOYHwnPyd1blpxYHZxWjA0VEc2fGxNXEZtSlx2amtuYWlKfU19dlJvfF1NSVdCNE08SGBIM0lfXG5Hf1RcakB9NURKR0lycl83UlxRYDVWMWNHTUNJfE5%2FcmJkbTFJdTBpRjQwSUlqNTVXfFYxVnxCRCcpJ2N3amhWYHdzYHcnP3F3cGApJ2lkfGpwcVF8dWAnPyd2bGtiaWBabHFgaCcpJ2BrZGdpYFVpZGZgbWppYWB3dic%2FcXdwYHgl
  /sessions endpoint data:
  {
    "success_url": "localhost:3000/checkout-confirmation",
    "cancel_url": "localhost:3000/checkout-review",
    "line_items": [
      {
        "price_data": {
          "currency": "usd",
          "product_data": { "name": "Custom Donation" },
          "unit_amount": 5000 // Note that this has to be in cents
        },
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ]
  }

  Seeing a $2.00 on the stripe checkout page instead of $200.00, event though the unit_amount is actually 200:
    data: '{"success_url":"http://localhost:3000/checkout-confirmation","cancel_url":"http://localhost:3000/checkout-review","line_items":[{"price_data":{"currency":"usd","product_data":{"name":"Donation"},"unit_amount":200},"quantity":1}]}'

  <{ emailAddress: string; customDonation: string; presetDonation: string; materialDonationsTotalCost: number }>

  From Stripe regarding email field:
  customer_email: string
    If provided, this value will be used when the Customer object is created. 
    If not provided, customers will be asked to enter their email address. 
    Use this parameter to prefill customer data if you already have an email on file. 
    To access information about the customer once a session is complete, use the customer field.

  url flow from stripe:
    Checkout review -> Stripe 
      User hits cancel, sends them back 
       - Need to save ALL global data that was entered, but this wipes out global state -> maybe save in a cookie?
          should we have a listener for browswer nav, if coming from Stripe back to checkout-review, to rewrite browser history and chop off last Stripe page (no, looks like Stripe does already)
          On "Proceed to Checkout", 
          Also on this page load "hydrate" the presetDonation, customDonation, materialDonationsTotalCost from localStorage
    Stripe -> checkout-confirmation

    Do we need a "clear cart" option also? Yeah prob

    Only show cart to regular users
      For simplicity, always show it; just show empty cart if nothing in localStorage

Final TODOs (Google sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pk9st2rijPqZ7glJ78Z6IDHLCJ-m1GtDpqNjMHnqtk8/edit?usp=sharing)
  Heading:
    Help Rebuild Hot Springs
  Only show user nav icon if user is administrator (David?), or remove it?
    Hide account link for all
  Fix logic for financial donation/materials donation (only show error if BOTH are null)
    Need to separate end total (show delivery if they selected delivery, separate from the financial and show subtotal etc)
  Add api error handling to materials endpoint 
  Fix up/down counter on input for Safari (no arrows), and error handling for when entering more than the allowed number via the keyboard
    (counter prevents going up but keyboard is not prevented)
  Stripe customer_email not getting passed (maybe due to test mode?)
    email David example
  Whisky image easter egg (actually put a background in or a repeating pattern?)
    Remove on the main page
  Do we need a better way to show the "Continue" button on the materials screen (hard to see all the way at the bottom)
    Future todo related to table UI etc
  Delivery info if chose delivery 
    Show them the delivery info on the checkout confirmation page ()
  Social share nothing done yet besides dummy link
    nothing done yet
  Format user phone display on cart view
  Materials table update
    Keep remaining, rename it to Needed (remove Donated)
    David will shorten name title
    Look at options for presenting the items as cards (maybe categories) -> would be later update
  Put something at the top for instructions for some pages
  Remove the Projects link page
  David will do an About content

* Separate financial from materail on totals 
  material breakdown:
    global state update:

What if they ONLY select material deliveries?
  Just route straight to checkout confirmation?
  Button just say continue?

Allow to select zero on materials donation after selecting something else?
  right now, you can't update the amount to zero

Need to add favicon

11/23/24
  Tested some social media share buttons on-site from ShareThis

  Realized when you delete a cart item, it doesn't clear your  localstorage; need to fix that 

  Maybe add some animations?
